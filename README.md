# Autohotkey-project-generator

This is a project generator using the scripting language of Autohotkey(https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Put the script(with the template folder of course) in a folder beside your c++ projects or any other type of project(since you can change the template to anything you want).

It will execute, ask you the name of your project and create a folder with directly all the files needed.

Autorun feature: Put the name of every file you want to be executed after the creation of the project into auto-open.txt in the template folder all separated by a new line.
