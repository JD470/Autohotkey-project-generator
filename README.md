# Autohotkey-project-generator

This is a project generator using the scripting language of Autohotkey(https://www.autohotkey.com/).

This script is made to simplify and make faster the creation of a new project, create a template with all the files needed in it, you can specify all the files you want to open automatically in auto-open.txt(all file names separated by a newline). You can also put where the template will be copied to in project-parent.txt(relative paths are allowed!).
