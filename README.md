# Autohotkey-project-generator

This is a project generator using the scripting language of Autohotkey(https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Put it in a folder with the template beside your c++ projects or any other type of project(since you can change the template to anything you want).

It will execute, ask you the name of your project and create a folder with directly all the files needed, it will then open the main file.
