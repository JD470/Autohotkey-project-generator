# Raylib-Autohotkey-project-generator

So it's basically a raylib projet generator using the scripting language of Autohotkey.

Put it in your c++ folder or any other type of project(since you can change the template).

It will execute, ask you the name of your project and create a folder with directly all the files needed and I added the functionality to execute the main file with VS Code but you can change it to anything or remove it.
